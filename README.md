## Important note on JTAG connections

If you have the original, single-connector JTAG adapter, it only works with the "white" JTAG cable. As shown here

If you have the new dual-connector JTAG adapter, be careful to connect the cable properly. 
If you have a white JTAG cable, it will connect to the connector labelled "WHT"
If you have a black JTAG cable, it will connect to the connector labelled "BLK"
